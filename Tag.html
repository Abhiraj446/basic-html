    <p><h3><i>Social control theory developed by Travis Hirschi specially states that all individuals actually have the potential to develop antisocial or criminal tendencies however it is the “bond” they share with society whether in the form of friendships, recognition of societal rules and norms of conduct, parental influences etc. that prevent them from manifesting such behavior (Payne & Salotti, 2007).
    <br><br>
    Hirschi goes on further to state that crimes occur due to individuals either losing or weakening the various bonds which bind them to society and as such results in them not caring of the social ramifications of certain criminal actions.
    <br><br>
    It is based on this that it can be seen that instilling proper social-emotional learning early on in a child’s life is of paramount importance in ensuring that they develop the necessary social and emotional bonds as well as the right way of thinking in order to succeed in aspects related to school, family life, community obligations and work. It is based on this that this paper will explore the various qualities needed in order for a child to develop into a proper and well-balanced adult that is ready to tackle whatever life throws their way.

    <p><h2><b>What is needed for positive social development?</b></h2></p>

    <p><h3><i>All individuals need to have a skill set that helps them cope not only with social interactions but with personal relations and the bonds that help to keep them in place. It is based on this that one of the first personal capabilities that contribute to positive social development is empathy. Empathy is a way in which an individual is able to understand either the positive or negative aspects of another person’s life.
    <br><br>
    It helps to facilitate a moment of deep thought and reflection wherein they place themselves in that person’s shoes and “feel” how certain positive or negative events would feel if it happened to them. It is through this that people learn how to promote positive behaviors and limit negative ones due to their perception over how it would be like if such experiences had occurred to them as well.
    <br><br>
    The second personal capability needed is tolerance; all too often people encounter various situations in their life that test their patience whether it comes in the form of a frustrating spouse, a demanding boss at work or even certain events that don’t go the way they were planned.
